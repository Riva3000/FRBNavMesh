------- class NavMeshPlugin -------
	buildMeshFromTiled
	- loads Tiled editor tile map .tmx file
	- finds chosen Object layer in it
	- gets all AARects from that layer
	- [ new NavMesh() ]
		- creates NavMesh from them by passing them to NavMesh constructor
	- (why?) stores the resulting NavMesh in List of NavMeshes
	- returns resulting NavMesh

------- class NavMesh -------
	Represents a navigation mesh built from a series of polygons (now specificaly AARects).

	functions:
		[ constructor ] Creates NavMesh from List of AARects.
			- Creates NavPoly from each AARect
			- Assigns ID to that NavPoly
			- [ _calculateNeighbors ]
				- Finds neighbors for each NavPoly and puts them into NavPoly's neighbors List
				- Finds portals between each neighbor NavPoly's and puts them into NavPoly's portals List
			- [ new NavGraph( List<NavPoly> this._navPolygons ) ]
				- Creates NavGraph
					to export it's data to Astar-unerstandable format
					and stores it in it's _graph var
			
		findPath
			- finds path.
					Using Astar.search()
			- smooths path
					By finding Channel-s
					And calling Channel.stringPull()
			- returns path as List of Points. Or null if path doesn't exist.


------- class NavGraph -------
	Graph for javascript-astar. It implements the functionality for astar.
	Makes available for Astar:
		List<NavPoly> nodes
		List<NavPoly> neighbors()
		double navHeuristic()



------- class NavPoly -------
	Node
	..
